# 🎯 CSS Transition Timing Functions – Demo

A visual demonstration of **CSS transition timing functions**, showing how different easing curves affect the speed and behavior of animations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

CSS transitions control how smoothly a property changes from one value to another.  
This project illustrates the difference between various **`transition-timing-function` values** using a simple hover-based width animation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and compare:

- CSS transitions  
- Timing functions and easing curves  
- Hover-based animations  
- Visual differences between transition behaviors  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧱 Multiple elements with different timing functions  
- 🖱️ Hover interaction to trigger transitions  
- ⏱️ Visual comparison of speed curves  
- 🎨 Simple and clean UI for clarity  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  

---

## 🧩 Timing Functions Demonstrated

- **linear** – Constant speed throughout  
- **ease** – Slow start, fast middle, slow end  
- **ease-in** – Slow start  
- **ease-out** – Slow end  
- **ease-in-out** – Slow start and end  

Each transition animates the width of the element when hovered.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the file as `transition_timing_function.html`  
2. Open it in any modern web browser  
3. Hover over each box to observe the animation behavior  

_No setup required._

---

## 📈 Concepts Used

- CSS `transition` property  
- `transition-timing-function`  
- Hover pseudo-class  
- Flexbox alignment  

---

## 📜 Conclusion

This project provides a clear, visual way to understand how **CSS timing functions** affect animations.  
It is especially useful for beginners learning **UI animation and interaction design**.
